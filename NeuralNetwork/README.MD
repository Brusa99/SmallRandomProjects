# Neural Network

This project was made for the "Introduzione alla Teoria delle Reti Neurali" course, in April 2022.
The aim of the project is to implement a _neural network_ without using dedicated libraries.
I implemented a _feed forward neural network_ that recognizes handwritten numbers, using the [mnist database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv).
