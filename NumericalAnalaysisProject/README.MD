# Numerical Analysis Project

## Number Classification

The projects consists in implementing distances to measure distance between numbers in the mnist database and than use the balltree algorithm to build a classifier.
All functions are timed and different hyperparameters of the model are tested, plotting the error.  
Training and testing of the algorithm were performed on the _orfeo_ cluster.  

### Contents

- `assignment_SimoneBrusatin.ipynb` is the notebook of the project.  
- `run.sh` is a bash script to measure error for different hyperparameters.  
- `balltree.py` is the python code used by the bash script to obtain the measurements.  
- `data/` contains the data used for the notebook.
