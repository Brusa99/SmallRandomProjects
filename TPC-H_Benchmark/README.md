# TPC-H Benchmark

This is the project for the _Data Management for Big Data_ course, that I took as part of the degree in DSSC.
The goal is to implement a query and optimize it. More info can be found in `report.pdf`.

- `createDB.sql` is used to implement the database.
- `tables.sql` implements the tables.
- `add_keys.sql` adds primary and foreign keys to the tables.
- `indexes` adds indexes to the table.
